# Introduction to the Command Line / Bash
This repo supports the workshop materials for Parts I and II of this two-part series of workshops intended to introduce users to the \*nix command line using various type of examples, including some from the field of genomics.

# Preparation for the class
## Software
Mac users don't need to install anything.

If you are using Windows, you will need to install software on your machine that will allow access to the [Bash Shell](https://workshops.rcs.northwestern.edu/install/bash/). There are a few different options, but for beginner-level users we recommend [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Those who have access to [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) are welcome to use it instead. Whichever method you choose, the software should be installed *beforehand*. We will not have time to assist you with this during the workshop.

Download the .zip file for this repository, unzip it, and put it **on your computer's desktop**. (Click on the green "Clone or download" button above, then click on the "Download zip" link.) This file contains the data folder, slides, and other materials for the class.
