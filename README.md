# Command Line for Genomics
Materials for the Intro to Command Line for Genomics workshops. This is a 2-part series of workshops intended to introduce users to the command line, using genomic data examples. 

# Preparation for the class
## Software
Mac users don't need to install anything. Windows users, install a [Bash Shell](https://workshops.rcs.northwestern.edu/install/bash/) *before* the workshop. We will not have time to assist you with installing bash during the workshop.
